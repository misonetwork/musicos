/**
 * `PerTrack<Data>` — one `Data` value per track of a release, held in tracklist
 * order.
 * 
 * A release's tracks are a flat, ordered `vector<Track>`, frozen at release
 * creation. `PerTrack` is the parallel array to that list: index `i` holds the
 * payload for the `i`-th track. It is the shared shape behind per-track release
 * metadata such as cover art (`PerTrack<Option<CoverArt>>`) or genre — and the
 * natural home for display grouping (disc/side boundaries), which core
 * deliberately does not store.
 * 
 * Construction reads the `Release` and sizes/validates the array against
 * `total_tracks()`, so a `PerTrack` is parallel to the tracklist _by construction_
 * — an extension cannot attach a misaligned array. Because a release's tracklist
 * is frozen at creation, that alignment holds for the release's whole life.
