/// Represents a music release in Miso.
/// A release is an ordered tracklist with per-track revenue distribution
/// configuration. Cover art lives in the `cover_art` extension, not in core.
///
/// The tracklist is deliberately FLAT — a `vector<Track>` with no disc
/// structure. Grouping a sequence into discs, vinyl sides, acts, or movements
/// is a property of a distribution medium, not of the release: it has more
/// than one correct rendering, which makes it presentation, and presentation
/// lives in the metadata extension. A consequence worth stating: the stored
/// tracklist and the digest pre-image have the same shape, so what signers
/// consented to is exactly what is stored — nothing structural is chosen
/// after consent except the title.
///
/// ### Key Features:
///
/// - Ordered flat tracklist (grouping is presentation, in the metadata extension)
/// - Configurable per-track revenue splits
/// - State machine: Initialized -> Published
///
/// Attribution (credits, primary/featured artists) is intentionally NOT part of
/// core: it is display-oriented, varies across platforms, and is never read by
/// the economics. It lives in a first-party credits extension attached via
/// `uid_mut`, so core takes no dependency on an identity package and core
/// publish enforces no attribution.
///
/// The same rule governs naming. Core stores what a thing *is* — identity and
/// everything the economics read; extensions describe it. The release's `title`
/// is the one embedded name: it is constitutive (naming the package is part of
/// creating it) and freezing it at publish is a buyer-facing guarantee. Edition
/// naming ("Deluxe Edition"), disc titles, localized titles, and DSP-shaped
/// slots all have more than one correct rendering — presentation — and live in
/// the metadata extension.
///
/// ### Consent scope
///
/// The release digest — and therefore the derived release id every `Track`
/// commits to at creation — binds the economics and membership of the
/// release: the ordered list of `(recording, split)` pairs and the creator's
/// nonce. It deliberately binds nothing else. The title — the one embedded
/// field outside the digest — and everything in the extension layer (artwork,
/// credits, display grouping) are chosen by the release creator, before or
/// after tracks are created, and are trusted and publicly attributable rather
/// than cryptographically committed. See `track::new` for the signer-side
/// statement of this boundary.
///
/// The derived id commits to the canonical registry's UID and the digest, not
/// the digest alone — so targeting an id also consents to that namespace's
/// liveness. If that parent were deleted, or its `&mut UID` became permanently
/// unreachable, the release could never exist and every track or offer
/// targeting it would be stranded — the same blast-radius class as a release
/// that simply never publishes. `ReleaseRegistry` is therefore created and
/// shared exactly once at package initialization, and exposes neither a
/// constructor, deletion path, nor mutable UID accessor.
///
/// ### Lifecycle and trust model
///
/// A release is `key`-only with no `drop`: a fresh `Initialized` object
/// cannot be transferred, wrapped, publicly shared, or discarded, and its only
/// by-value consumer is `publish`. Create-and-publish is therefore atomic by
/// construction — an `Initialized` release cannot outlive its creating
/// transaction, and every release that exists on-chain is `Published` and
/// shared. There is deliberately no keep function; assembling tracks, discs,
/// and the release must fit one transaction.
///
/// `uid_mut` works in any lifecycle state and is permanent root over ALL
/// dynamic fields on the object — including fields attached by other
/// extensions. "Immutable after publish" covers the embedded fields only;
/// extension-layer data stays admin-mutable in perpetuity. This is the
/// designed extension surface, and it is the one trust assumption that never
/// expires: integrators should model the cap holder as able to mutate or
/// delete any extension data, forever.
