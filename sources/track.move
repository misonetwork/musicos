/// A `Track` is the minimal positioned (recording, revenue-share) pair:
/// - `recording_id` — the routing target for the track's revenue, and the
///   handle through which all other metadata (title, cover art, and the
///   recording/composition share-type identities) is reached.
/// - `composition_id` — the identity of the recording's underlying work, so
///   the composition–recording–release graph is walkable on-chain from the
///   release alone. Move cannot chase an ID to an object, so this edge is
///   unreachable in a track loop unless embedded here.
/// - `split_bps` — this track's share of the release's revenue; genuinely
///   release-specific and not derivable from the recording.
/// - `state` — the assign-once lifecycle that carries (then sheds) the
///   recording admin's target release commitment, made at creation; see
///   `TrackState`.
///
/// `Track` is intentionally monomorphic: a `Release` holds a `vector<Track>`
/// of tracks from many different recordings/compositions, so it cannot be
/// generic over their share types. It stores no title, cover art, or
/// share-type — those are consumed off-chain and derived from the recording
/// via `recording_id`; a `Track` embeds exactly the facts on-chain consumers
/// cannot reach any other way.

/// verifies the match and transitions the track to `Assigned`, which carries

// === Public Functions ===

/// Creates a new track: the recording admin's consent to that recording's
/// inclusion in a specific future release with an agreed split.
/// Requires the recording admin capability. No event: a `Track` has `drop`
/// and is not an object, so a creation event could announce a consent that is
/// then silently discarded, and indexers would be unable to distinguish
/// pending from dead. Pre-publish observability is the responsibility of
/// whatever wraps the track (see below).
///
/// The recording↔composition pairing is compile-time enforced by the
/// recording's `CompositionShare` phantom, and its address-level counterpart
/// is embedded on the recording at creation — so the composition id is copied
/// from the `&Recording` argument with no `Composition` argument and no
/// runtime check needed.
///
/// ### What creating a track consents to
///
/// `target_release_id` is derived from the release digest, so targeting it
/// consents to that release's exact economics and membership: the ordered
/// list of `(recording, split)` pairs and the creator's nonce, nothing more.
/// The release's title, artwork, credits, and display grouping are chosen by
/// the release creator — before or after this track is created — and are not
/// bound by the digest. Presentation is trusted and publicly attributable,
/// not cryptographically committed.
///
/// The recording need not be `Published`: its admin can create tracks inside
/// the recording's own creating transaction (an `Initialized` recording
/// cannot escape that transaction, so across transactions tracks always
/// reference `Published`, shared recordings).
///
/// A `Track` has `store`, not `key`: it carries no identity of its own, so it
/// may be exercised synchronously in the same transaction that creates it, or
/// handed to an offer extension that wraps it in a real object with its own
/// identity. Withdrawal, expiry, and rejection are then whatever that
/// wrapping extension encodes — visible in its type, not in core.
///
/// `recording` compile-time-binds the `RecordingShare`/`CompositionShare`
/// phantom pairing, and is read for its own id and its embedded composition
/// id: the monomorphic `Track` must store both *addresses* — the recording's
/// for revenue routing, the composition's for graph reachability — and an
/// address cannot come from a phantom.

// publish, and there is no extraction path — so a track read out of a (shared,
// therefore published) release is always `Assigned`, and a track anywhere else
// is always `Unassigned`. No runtime caller learns anything from asking which
// variant a track is in — these boolean predicates remain information-free —
// but the unassigned variant's payload, the target release id, is genuinely
// runtime-relevant (an offer extension reads it to route or validate a
// pending track), hence the public `target_release_id` accessor above.
