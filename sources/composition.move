/// Represents a musical composition (song, instrumental work) in Miso.
/// Compositions are the underlying written works that recordings are based on.
/// Each composition has its own share token for ownership distribution.
///
/// ### Key Features:
///
/// - Share token initialization with fixed supply (10M tokens, 6 decimals)
/// - State machine: Initialized -> Published (embedded fields immutable after
///   publish; dynamic fields remain extensible via `uid_mut`)
/// - Deterministic addresses via derived object pattern
///
/// Attribution (credits) is intentionally NOT part of core: it is
/// display-oriented, varies across platforms, and is never read by the
/// economics. It lives in a first-party credits extension attached via
/// `uid_mut`, so core takes no dependency on an identity package and core
/// publish enforces no attribution.
///
/// ### Lifecycle and trust model
///
/// A composition is `key`-only with no `drop`: a fresh `Initialized` object
/// cannot be transferred, wrapped, publicly shared, or discarded, and its only
/// by-value consumer is `publish`. Create-and-publish is therefore atomic by
/// construction — an `Initialized` composition cannot outlive its creating
/// transaction, and every composition that exists on-chain is `Published` and
/// shared. There is deliberately no keep function; staged building must fit
/// one transaction.
///
/// `uid_mut` works in any lifecycle state and is permanent root over ALL
/// dynamic fields on the object — including fields attached by other
/// extensions. "Immutable after publish" covers the embedded fields only;
/// extension-layer data stays admin-mutable in perpetuity. This is the
/// designed extension surface, and it is the one trust assumption that never
/// expires: integrators should model the cap holder as able to mutate or
/// delete any extension data, forever.

// === Derivation Keys ===

/// Key for deriving the admin capability's deterministic address from the composition.

// === Enums ===

/// Lifecycle state of a composition.
public enum CompositionState has copy, drop, store {
    /// Composition is initialized but not published.

    /// Composition is published and immutable. Includes publication timestamp.
    Published(
        /// Timestamp (ms) when published.
        u64,
    ),
}

// === Events ===

/// Emitted once when a composition is published. A pure pointer: it carries the
/// composition's identity. A composition's embedded fields — title and royalty
/// rate included — are immutable, so an indexer treats this as a signal to
/// fetch the full object by `composition_id` once; all indexed data, including
/// the publish timestamp, lives in the object itself and never changes.

    composition_id: ID,
}

// === Constants ===

/// Maximum length of a title in bytes.
const MAX_TITLE_LENGTH: u64 = 300;

// === Errors ===

// State errors (10-19)
/// Operation requires Initialized state but composition is in a different state.

/// Title exceeds maximum length.

// === Public Functions ===

// === Lifecycle ===

/// Creates a new composition with the given title and royalty rate.
///
/// The rate is set once, here, and is immutable for the composition's
/// lifetime: it is a permanent standing offer that recorders and share buyers
/// can price against without trusting the admin. The protocol imposes no
/// opinion on it beyond the arithmetic bound of 100% (10000 bps, enforced by
/// `bps::new`). There is no floor — 0% is permitted (e.g. a generative
/// recording with no authored composition) — and no protocol ceiling: an
/// uncompetitive rate simply attracts no recordings. What rate is reasonable
/// is a client-side concern; per-deal deviations settle as voluntary share
/// transfers after recording creation.
/// Initializes share tokens (10M supply, 6 decimals) and returns:
/// - The composition object
/// - Admin capability for the owner
/// - Initial share token balance
