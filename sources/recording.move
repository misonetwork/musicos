/// Represents an audio recording of a composition in Miso.
/// Recordings are the audio performances that are distributed and played.
/// Each recording has its own share token for ownership distribution.
///
/// ### Key Features:
///
/// - Share token initialization with fixed supply (10M tokens, 6 decimals)
/// - State machine: Initialized -> Published (embedded fields immutable after
///   publish; dynamic fields remain extensible via `uid_mut`, e.g. masters,
///   and credits/attribution attached by the credits extension)
/// - Deterministic addresses via derived object pattern
///
/// Attribution (credits, primary/featured artists) is intentionally NOT part of
/// core: it is display-oriented, varies across platforms, and is never read by
/// the economics. It lives in a first-party credits extension attached via
/// `uid_mut`, so core takes no dependency on an identity package and core
/// publish enforces no attribution.
///
/// A recording carries no name of its own. Its display title is its
/// composition's title, read by reference — composition titles are immutable,
/// so an embedded copy would carry no information. Anything that names this
/// particular take — "(Live)", "Radio Edit", a translated title — has more
/// than one correct rendering, which makes it presentation, and presentation
/// lives in the metadata extension, never in the frozen core. Core stores what
/// a recording *is*; extensions describe it.
///
/// ### Lifecycle and trust model
///
/// A recording is `key`-only with no `drop`: a fresh `Initialized` object
/// cannot be transferred, wrapped, publicly shared, or discarded, and its only
/// by-value consumer is `publish`. Create-and-publish is therefore atomic by
/// construction — an `Initialized` recording cannot outlive its creating
/// transaction, and every recording that exists on-chain is `Published` and
/// shared. There is deliberately no keep function; staged building must fit
/// one transaction.
///
/// `uid_mut` works in any lifecycle state and is permanent root over ALL
/// dynamic fields on the object — including fields attached by other
/// extensions. "Immutable after publish" covers the embedded fields only;
/// extension-layer data stays admin-mutable in perpetuity. This is the
/// designed extension surface, and it is the one trust assumption that never
/// expires: integrators should model the cap holder as able to mutate or
/// delete any extension data, forever.
///
/// The recording carries its parent composition's identity two ways. The
/// `CompositionShare` phantom type parameter is the durable identity (a share
/// currency is published independently of miso and survives a fresh
/// republish, whereas an object ID does not) and makes the
/// recording↔composition lineage compile-time enforced wherever the two meet.
/// The embedded `composition_id` is the address-level handle: Move cannot
/// chase a type (or an ID) to an object, so on-chain consumers holding only
/// `&Recording` — or a bare `Track` — could not otherwise reach the
/// composition at all. Both are set at creation and immutable, so they cannot
/// diverge.
///
/// A recording is its own freshly-created object (`object::new`), not a derived
/// child of its composition: `recording::new` takes a read-only `&Composition`
/// (only to read its royalty rate and id), so publishing recordings under a
/// composition neither contends on the composition's shared-object version nor
/// collides on a per-composition index.

/// The composition's royalty rate is immutable, so the rate a recorder's
