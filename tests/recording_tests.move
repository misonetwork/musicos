// A recording carries no naming fields: its display title is its composition's
// title, read by reference, and richer naming lives in the metadata extension.
// Naming behavior is therefore untestable here by design.

// Recordings are independent objects (fresh `object::new`), not derived children
// keyed by a per-composition index: two recordings created under one composition
// have distinct ids and require no contiguity/derivation. Concurrency- and
// id-independence behavior is covered by `production_constructor_tests`.
