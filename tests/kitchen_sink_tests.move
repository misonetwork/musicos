/// Structural stress test: proves every bound (255 tracks, 300-byte title,

/// re-fetch or sender-dependent behavior to assert on the shared object
/// afterward, so this stays a single `tx_context::dummy()` transaction rather
/// than a `test_scenario`.

// === Tests ===

// A recording kitchen-sink test used to exercise its naming fields at max
// bounds; recordings now carry no configurable embedded fields (naming lives
// in the metadata extension), so only the release retains structural bounds.

/// Kitchen sink test: creates a release with the structural fields at maximum
/// bounds.
/// - 255 tracks (MAX_TRACKS) in one flat tracklist
/// - Track splits sum to exactly 10000 BPS (55 x 40 + 200 x 39 = 10000)
/// - Title at 300 bytes (MAX_TITLE_LENGTH)
/// - Successfully publishes
